failed mnist cnn attempt from hs in early 2023. 

no ai used in the making of this code

was intended to help me learn about the fundementals of neural networks 0->1 (specifically the math)

didn't really use any sort of ml library/numpy (the hard part) 

ended up with a negligible result, hence the name

ran out of time to perfect it
